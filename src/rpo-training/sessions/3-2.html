Today, we're going to build the tool that does exactly that.</p></div><div class="content-section grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 items-center"><div class="md:col-span-2"><h3 class="google-sans text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">What is RAG? (The Simple Explanation)</h3><p class="mb-4">It stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and it sounds complicated, but the concept is simple.</p><div class="quote-box"><p class="text-lg italic">"RAG is the process of giving a brilliant expert (the AI) your private library of documents to read before they answer your question."</p></div><p class="mt-4">This ensures the answers are grounded in your data, not the public internet. It's secure, relevant, and incredibly powerful.</p></div><div class="flex justify-center"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-28 w-28 text-blue-500" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h7" /><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15 18h5a2 2 0 002-2V8a2 2 0 00-2-2h-5l-2 4 2 4zM4 6a2 2 0 012-2h12a2 2 0 012 2v12a2 2 0 01-2-2H6a2 2 0 01-2-2V6z" /></svg></div></div><div class="content-section"><h3 class="google-sans text-2xl font-bold text-center text-blue-600 mb-6">The Power of RAG: Meet Your "CV & Candidate Info Bot"</h3><p class="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6">This is what our final product will be able to do.
