# Learning Hub

This project is a centralized portal for AI training programs, sourcing tools, and interactive workshops for Randstad GBS.

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored to use a modern, scalable, and maintainable structure.

- **`src/`**: This directory contains all the source code for the project.
  - **`src/<module-name>/`**: Each learning module has its own directory.
    - **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the module.
    - **`js/`**: Contains the JavaScript files for the module.
    - **`css/`**: Contains the CSS files for the module.
  - **`src/data/`**: Contains all the JSON data files used by the different modules.
  - **`src/public/`**: Contains static assets like images that are copied directly to the build output.
- **`dist/`**: This directory contains the final, optimized build output. It is generated by running the `npm run build` command and should not be edited directly.
- **`vite.config.js`**: The configuration file for Vite, our build tool.
- **`package.json`**: The project's manifest file, containing metadata and a list of dependencies.

## Development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. The server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the source files will be reflected in the browser instantly.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will bundle and minify all the assets and output them to the `dist/` directory. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory to any static hosting service.
